Bitcoin Price Prediction Model

Overview

This repository contains a Bitcoin price prediction model developed using deep learning techniques. The model utilizes historical price data from Binance and news articles related to Bitcoin to forecast future price movements.

                      The predictions generated by the model are speculative in nature and should not be used as the sole basis for making investment decisions.
Risk of Loss: Investing in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, carries inherent risks. 
              Prices are highly volatile and can fluctuate significantly in a short period. 
              Users of this model should be aware of the potential for substantial financial losses and exercise caution when engaging in cryptocurrency trading or investment activities.
No Liability: The author(s) of this repository are not liable for any losses incurred as a result of using or relying on the predictions generated by the model. 
              Users assume full responsibility for their investment decisions and should conduct their own research and seek advice from qualified professionals before making any financial commitments.

How the Model Works

Data Collection: The model collects real-time historical price data from the Binance exchange and retrieves news articles related to Bitcoin using the News API.
Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes preprocessing to standardize the format and prepare it for input into the deep learning model. 
                This includes scaling numerical features, tokenizing and vectorizing textual data, and combining multiple data sources.
Model Architecture: The model architecture consists of multiple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers with dropout regularization. 
                    This architecture is designed to capture temporal dependencies in the data and mitigate overfitting.
Training: The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to minimize the difference between predicted and actual prices. 
          Training is performed iteratively using historical data, and the model's performance is evaluated on validation data.
Prediction: Once trained, the model is capable of predicting the future price of Bitcoin one day ahead. Predictions are made based on the most recent available data.

Limitations
1: Does not use technical analysis indicators to capture trends.
2: The News-API restricts the collection of news articles to those published within the past 30 days and thus may not fully account for longer-term patterns and events that could influence market dynamics.
3: After looking at the model data, I am quite sure that most cells in the RNN learn that the price is somewhat close to yesterdays price, this means that you get a "Lagging effect".
  The model lags behind real-time data because it pick up on it later and then readjusts its prediction. An IA model should therefore learn form changes in price and predict the future change in price instead of the actual price.
  This however, renders the model highly ineffective at price predictions.
